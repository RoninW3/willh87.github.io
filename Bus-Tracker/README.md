# PROJECT NAME:  
                 Real Time Bus Tracker

# ABOUT:          

                  This project involes the use of Mapbox API, styling with CSS, and animation with JS.
                 When running this program it will display a map provided by Mapbox's API with chosen satellite/street
                 styling. Additional styling is completed with the UI to improve UX with the addition of Zoom and 
                 plane adjustment. The marker color has been changed to Red.

# HOW TO DEPLOY:  
                After opening in the browser, there will be a styled CSS button with a hover effect. 
                Simply click the button and the JS will execute by moving the map marker to Latitude/Longitude
                of all the known bus stops between MIT and Harvard.

# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:   

                Future improvements for the project include different marker styling, in the form of a bus that
                changes colors, and improving the UI/UX for the user to change the style of the map between
                satellite to night mode to traffic mode layers.
