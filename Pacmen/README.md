## Pacmen Project

# ABOUT

  This project was created using MIT license, and is a JS DOM browser program. Pacmen are placed into an array with random locations, velocities, and trajectories. 
  A color flipper HEX generator has been added to improve UX and aesthetics. CSS styling has been added to buttons with hover effects.
