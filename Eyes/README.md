# Eyes
## Eyes project

# ABOUT
  
  Eyes is a project created with MIT license, and it is a JS DOM program to be viewed in the browser. Index.html is linked to styles.css and app.js.
  Several buttons have been added with increased functionality to create as many "eyes" as screen resolution will allow. A home button, href to https://willh87.github.io, has
  also been added. The program has multiple CSS stylings with hover effects in addition to the JS "onmouse" events in which the eyeballs will track the cursor on the screen.
  
# DEPLOYMENT

  Please feel free to load the .html file into the browser, or procede to https://willh87.github.io to interact with the project located in the "projects" page. On loading into the browser, click the "Make Eyes" button to create as many as your screen resolution can facilitate. Also hovering the mouse on the eyes will create a hover transition.
  
 # IMPROVEMENT
 
  Additionally a "Remove Eyes" button could be added, with the ability to dynamically remove .eye and .ball from the classlists using logic statements. Other enhancements to the flow of the movements and animations can also be dynamically added.
