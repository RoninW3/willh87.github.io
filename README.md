Thank you for visiting my personal page as I make the journey to become a full stack developer. I am currently a student with MIT XPRO. 

Projects that have been completed will be uploaded and will range from HTML, CSS, JS, MERN stack, and others for the duration of the course to showcase my work.

I will also be adding indepent projects and code as I make my journey into software development.
