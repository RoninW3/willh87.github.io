PORTFOLIO

#ABOUT

  Thank you for visiting my personal page as I make the journey to become a full stack developer. I am currently a student with MIT XPRO. 

  The portfolio is styled with CSS3 located in styles.css, also included is normalize.css which is MIT licensed This portfolio includes interactive JS scripts located in app.js for the Navbar/Sidebar toggle, the project flipper on the main page, and smooth scrolling.

  At this time there has been no use of BootStrap and has been coded from scratch using knowledge garnered at MIT xPRO and several independent courses at Udemy.com (certificates in ./about.html).

  All images used for the hero, and the project flipper were obtained from pexels.com (open source for images).

  Projects that have been completed will be uploaded and will range from HTML, CSS, JS, MERN stack, and others for the duration of the course to showcase my work.

  I will also be adding independent projects and code as I make my journey into web development. 

  Certifications and CEU's may be located in the "About" page on the portfolio.
